This is the documentation and source for the project developed by team 'JAM session' of Storming Robots School, Branchburg, NJ for 2024 International RoboCupJunior OnStage competition.

My role - software prototype of the hand signs recognition using Python AI libraries, Fusion 360 design and 3D printing of the part of the robot, testing.

RoboCupJunior(RCJ) International Competition, AI oriented robotics competition, Eidhoven, Netherlands, July 2024  - 2d place 'JAM Session' team;

RoboCupJunior USA, AI oriented robotics competition, Edison NJ, May 2024  - 1st place 'JAM Session' team; earned honor to represent USA in the RoboCupJunior International Competition in Netherlands, in July 2024

My team's RCJ project involved interpreting American Sign Language (ASL) and converting it into music played on a piano;  I utilized machine learning to train a model capable of understanding hand gestures, which were captured by a camera streaming video to the model. This data was then translated into keystrokes on a piano using robotic fingers . The robotic hands, custom-designed and 3D-printed. The primary objective was to promote the use of ASL and enhance its interpretation by machines, advancing inclusivity and accessibility for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing communities.
